Supporting Elements (e.g., presenters, logo images):\n  - Generate only when relevant content exists in reference materials\n\nGenerate content for each element and output in the following format:\n{\n  \"element1\": {\n    \"data\": [\"text1\", \"text2\"] for text elements\n          or [\"/path/to/image\", \"...\"] for image elements\n  },\n}\n\nInput:\nSchema:\n{'main_title': {'description': 'The primary title of the slide which succinctly describes the main topic', 'type': 'text', 'suggestedCharacters': '<18', 'default_quantity': 1}, 'subtitle': {'description': 'A subtitle that provides additional context or detail about the main topic', 'type': 'text', 'suggestedCharacters': '<82', 'default_quantity': 1}, 'presenter': {'description': 'Name of the person or people responsible for the presentation', 'type': 'text', 'suggestedCharacters': '<16', 'default_quantity': 1}}\n\nMetadata of Presentation:\ntitle: Improving Language Model Reasoning Capabilities with Reinforcement Learning\nauthor: Not Specified\npublish date: 2024\norganization: Not Specified\nPresentation Time: 2025-02-01\n\nSlide 1: Opening of 'Improving Language Model Reasoning Capabilities with Reinforcement Learning'\nSlide 2: Introduction to Improving Reasoning through Reinforcement Learning\nSlide 3: Key Contributions in Reinforcement Learning and Model Distillation\nSlide 4: Evaluation Results Summary\nSlide 5: Conclusion and Future Directions\n\nReference Text:\nSlide-5 Slide Purpose: Conclusion and Future Directions\nSlide Description: Conclusive remarks on leveraging reinforcement learning for improving reasoning in language models, and potential future directions in model enhancement.\n\n\nAvailable Images:\nNo Images\n\nOutput: Ensure the generated content strictly adheres to the schema specifications, follows the slide style, reader-friendly.", "response": "```json\n{\n  \"main_title\": {\n    \"data\": [\"Conclusion\"]\n  },\n  \"subtitle\": {\n    \"data\": [\"Future Directions in Enhancing Language Models with Reinforcement Learning\"]\n  },\n  \"presenter\": {\n    \"data\": [\"N/A\"]\n  }\n}\n```", "message": [{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Task: Generate engaging slide content based on the provided schema and reference materials.\n\nRequirements:\n1.
