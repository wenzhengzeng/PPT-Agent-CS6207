                    "content": "In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been rapidly evolving, diminishing the gap towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Post-training has become a crucial component in enhancing reasoning tasks and user preferences with minimal computational resources. OpenAI's o1 series introduced inference-time scaling for reasoning tasks, but effective test-time scaling remains a challenge. Prior approaches, like reinforcement learning (RL) and search algorithms, haven't achieved the performance of o1 models."

Using DeepSeek-V3-Base and GRPO framework, the training led to DeepSeek-R1-Zero with remarkable reasoning behaviors. Despite challenges like readability, enhanced models like DeepSeek-R1 incorporate cold-start data and multi-stage training for superior performance. The model outperforms benchmarks and matches OpenAI-o1's performance in reasoning tasks."
