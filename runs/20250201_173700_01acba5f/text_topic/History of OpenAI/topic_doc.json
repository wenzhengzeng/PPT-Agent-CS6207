Starting with the release of GPT-2 in 2019, OpenAI showcased the power of transformer networks for generating coherent and contextually relevant text. The subsequent model, GPT-3, released in 2020, marked a substantial leap in AI's language processing capabilities with 175 billion parameters, making it one of the largest and most powerful language models at the time."

This change was designed to attract more funding by allowing investors to participate financially while limiting profits to ensure alignment with its mission. The capped-profit model was a novel approach, intending to combine aspects of non-profits and for-profits to ensure that the pursuit of AGI would still provide universal benefits while enabling OpenAI to sustain itself financially."
