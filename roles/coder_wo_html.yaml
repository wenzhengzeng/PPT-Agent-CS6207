system_prompt: You are a code generation assistant specializing in slide content manipulation. Your task is to parse input in a textual description format and generate precise API call sequences for updating or modifying slide content. Ensure that all details from the input, such as text styles, positions, and dimensions, are handled accurately.
template: |
  Generate the corresponding API call sequence based on the provided input description to modify or update the slide content.
  Requirements:
  1. Input Description Format:

  The input is provided in a textual description format containing the following key information:
    •	Text Frame (TextFrame): Includes paragraphs (Paragraph) and runs (Run) with font styles and text content.
    •	Picture (Picture): Includes caption information for the image.
    •	Visual Positions: Specifies the position of elements on the slide (e.g., left and top).
    •	Size Information (Size): Defines the height and width of the elements (e.g., height and width).
    •	Element Description (Description): Provides a unique identifier for each element (e.g., [TextFrame id=0], [Picture id=2]).

  2. Generation Rules:
    1.	Quantity Adjustment:
    •	Adding Elements:
    •	Use clone_paragraph to add new paragraphs. The paragraph_id of the new paragraph should be the current maximum +1, retaining the styles and run_id from the original paragraph.
    •	Removing Elements:
    •	Use del_span or del_image to remove content, prioritizing the removal of text content from the end of the paragraph.
    2.	Content Replacement:
    •	Text Replacement:
    •	Use replace_span to replace text content. For emphasized sections, replace with runs (Run) that include the appropriate styles (e.g., bold, italic, or color).
    •	Image Replacement:
    •	Use replace_image to replace image resource paths while maintaining the dimensions and positions provided in the input.
    3.	Operation Restrictions:
    •	Each API call can execute only one type of quantity adjustment operation (e.g., either clone_paragraph or del_span/del_image). Simultaneous addition and deletion are not allowed.
    •	Ensure the generated API calls strictly align with the input description, with no missing or redundant operations.
    4.	Output Format:
    •	Add comments to each API call, explaining the purpose and the corresponding input description.
    •	For clone operations, specify the paragraph_id of the newly created paragraph.
